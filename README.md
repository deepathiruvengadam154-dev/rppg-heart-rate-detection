# Contactless Vital Sign Monitoring

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on monitoring human vital signs such as heart rate without physical contact.  
The idea became more important during the COVID-19 period, where direct contact with patients was unsafe.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional vital sign monitoring requires physical contact, which increases health risks during infectious situations like COVID-19.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A camera-based system is proposed to detect vital signs without touching the patient.  
Image processing techniques are used to analyze subtle changes and estimate vital signs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java  
- OpenCV  
- Basic Image Processing concepts

## ⚠️ Current Status
This project is in the **prototype stage**.  
Real-time camera integration is not fully implemented yet.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Real-time camera integration  
- Improved accuracy  
- Support for multiple patients  
- Mobile or web-based interface
